    "  - Prefixed with 'v' || Represent 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of each vertex in the model\n",
    "- **Texture Coordinates**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'vt' || Define 2D coordinates (u, v) for texture mapping\n",
    "- **Vertex Normals**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'vn' || Specify normal vectors for vertices, crucial for shading\n",
    "- **Parameter Space Vertices**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'vp' || Used in curve or surface geometry\n",
    "- **Faces**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'f' || Define polygons using vertex indices\n",
    "- **Object Names**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'o' || Identify distinct objects within the file\n",
    "- **Group Names**:\n",
    "  - Prefixed with 'g' || Organize faces into named groups\n",
    "- **Smoothing Groups**:\n",

    "### Convert OBJ, MTL and Textures to GLB\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are sure that all referenced materials and textures are available and valid, we can convert everything into one GLB file. This has multiple advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consolidation**: GLB (Binary glTF) combines geometry, materials, textures, and animations into a single binary file, simplifying asset management and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compression**: GLB files are typically smaller than the sum of their OBJ, MTL, and texture components, reducing storage requirements and improving load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Wide Compatibility**: GLB is widely supported across various 3D platforms, game engines, and web browsers, enhancing portability and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standardization**: As part of the glTF 2.0 specification, GLB follows a well-defined standard, ensuring consistent interpretation across different software and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficient Rendering**: GLB files are optimized for real-time rendering, making them ideal for interactive 3D applications and WebGL-based visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Metadata Support**: GLB allows for the inclusion of custom metadata, which can be useful for preserving information about the model's origin, authorship, or other relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Texture Embedding**: All textures are embedded within the GLB file, eliminating the need to manage multiple separate image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Animation Support**: If the original model includes animations, these can be preserved and efficiently encoded in the GLB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **PBR Material Support**: GLB supports Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, allowing for more realistic and consistent material representations across different rendering engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Future-Proofing**: As a modern and actively maintained format, GLB is likely to have continued support and improvements, making it a good choice for long-term asset preservation.\n",
