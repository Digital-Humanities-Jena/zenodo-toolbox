    "# Zenodo Toolbox: Database Integration (SQLite)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate a SQLite database with the Zenodo Toolbox with a preset structure. We'll use the database to store and manage information about Zenodo records, making it easier to track and query our data submissions. Most database operations are handled automatically by those functions that are interacting with Zenodo, but in order to provide some knowledge to customize the toolbox for individual projects, this Notebooks helps to understand the underlying processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using SQLite as our database engine. The configuration is defined in a YAML file, which specifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database type (local SQLite)\n",
    "- Database file path\n",
    "- Table structures\n",
    "- Indexes and foreign key relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of our database structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Records**: Stores main record information (concept_recid, title, DOI, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Links**: Contains various URLs associated with each record\n",
    "3. **Mainfiles**: Tracks files uploaded to each record\n",
    "4. **States**: Keeps track of availability status for different record components\n",
    "5. **Thumbnails**: Stores links to thumbnail images at various resolutions\n",
    "6. **Responses**: Saves raw JSON responses from Zenodo API calls\n",
    "7. **Rate Limiter**: Helps manage API request frequency\n",
    "8. **Operations**: Logs operations performed on records\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Integration Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Database Connection**: We'll create a connection to our SQLite database using the configuration from our YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Tables**: If they don't exist, we'll create the necessary tables as defined in our configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insert/Update Records**: As we interact with Zenodo (creating drafts, uploading files, publishing records), we'll store the relevant information in our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query Data**: We'll demonstrate how to retrieve information from our database, allowing for easy tracking and management of our Zenodo submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Database Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized Data Access**: Maintain a local record of all Zenodo interactions\n",
    "- **Efficient Querying**: Quickly find and analyze your Zenodo submissions\n",
    "- **Version Tracking**: Keep track of the status and versions of each record and its components\n",
    "- **Performance**: Reduce the need for frequent API calls by storing data locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by initializing our database connection and creating the necessary tables.\n"
