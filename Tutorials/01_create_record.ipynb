    "# Zenodo-Toolbox: Create a Record\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Zenodo Toolbox to create a new record on Zenodo, utilizing both the validator and API functionalities. The process involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Up the Environment**: We'll configure our environment to use either the Zenodo Sandbox (for testing) or the production Zenodo, and set up our API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preparing Metadata**: We'll create a sample metadata dictionary that describes our record. This metadata includes essential information such as the title, description, creators, and license of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validating Metadata**: Before submitting to Zenodo, we'll use the Zenodo Toolbox's validator function to ensure our metadata meets Zenodo's requirements. This step helps catch any errors or missing information before attempting to create the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating the Record**: Once our metadata is validated, we'll use the Zenodo Toolbox's API functionality to create a new draft record on Zenodo. This step involves sending our metadata to Zenodo's API and handling the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reviewing the Results**: After attempting to create the record, we'll examine the response from Zenodo to confirm whether the record was successfully created and to retrieve important information about the new record.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The first code cell will set up our environment with the following configurations:\n",
    "- Choose between Zenodo Sandbox (testing) and Production environments.\n",
    "- Decide whether to use environment variables for API keys or hardcoded keys.\n",
    "- Set up headers and parameters for API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures that we're using the correct environment and API key for our operations. It's crucial to verify these settings before proceeding with creating a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by running the initial configuration code.\n"

    "   - Other codes (like 400, 403, etc.) indicate various types of errors.\n",

    "3. **Message**: \n",
    "   - `result_msg['text']` provides a human-readable description of what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Errors**: \n",
    "   - If there were any errors, `result_msg['errors']` will contain more detailed information about what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result Data**: \n",
    "   - If the record was created successfully, `result_data` will contain information about the new record, such as its ID, URL, and other details.\n",
