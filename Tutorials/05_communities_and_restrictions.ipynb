    "\n",
    "1. Log in to your Zenodo account at [https://sandbox.zenodo.org/](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Community Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a community, you'll need to provide the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifier**: A unique identifier for your community (e.g., \"my-research-group\")\n",
    "- **Title**: The name of your community\n",
    "- **Description**: A brief description of the community's purpose and scope\n",
    "- **Curation policy**: Guidelines for what content is acceptable in the community\n",
    "- **Page**: An optional longer description or homepage for the community\n",
    "- **Logo**: An image to represent your community (recommended size: 90x90 pixels)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Settings\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Go to your community page\n",

    "## Access Restrictions and Accessing Restricted Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Zenodo offers different levels of access restrictions for uploaded datasets and files. Understanding these restrictions is crucial for both data providers and users. The three main types of access restrictions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Open Access\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Files are freely available for anyone to download and use.\n",
    "- **Visibility**: Metadata and files are publicly visible and downloadable.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Ideal for open science initiatives and maximizing research impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Embargoed Access\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Files are temporarily restricted but will become openly accessible after a specified date.\n",
    "- **Visibility**: Metadata is visible, but files are not downloadable until the embargo lifts.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful for datasets associated with upcoming publications or patent applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Restricted Access\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Files are only accessible to specific users or groups.\n",
    "- **Visibility**: Metadata may be visible, but file access is controlled.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Suitable for sensitive data, proprietary information, or datasets with ethical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Restricted Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook sections, you'll learn two key aspects of handling restricted data on Zenodo:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Making Data Restricted**: You'll discover how to upload files and set appropriate access restrictions using the Zenodo API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Restricted Data**: We'll explore methods to programmatically request and retrieve restricted data through the API, with proper authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "These practical exercises will equip you with the skills to manage sensitive data effectively on the Zenodo platform, both as a data provider and a data user.\n",
