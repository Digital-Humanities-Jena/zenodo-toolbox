These features allow for sophisticated image analysis and metadata enrichment, enhancing the quality and searchability of image-based Zenodo records.

### Excel Processing and Batch Operations

The toolbox provides robust Excel processing capabilities:

- Extract metadata from structured Excel files to create or update Zenodo records
- Perform batch operations on multiple records simultaneously
- Implement advanced filtering and data manipulation techniques
- Generate comprehensive reports and summaries from Excel data

These features streamline the process of managing large datasets and creating multiple Zenodo records from structured data sources.

### 3D Model Handling

- Generate 2D thumbnails and previews for 3D models
- Extract metadata specific to 3D models, including vertex count, face count, and bounding box dimensions
- Perform basic transformations on 3D models, such as scaling and rotation

These capabilities extend the toolbox's utility to researchers and institutions working with 3D digital assets.

### XML Generation for Linked Data

The toolbox includes functions for generating standardized XML formats:

- Create Europeana Data Model (EDM) XML files, facilitating integration with Europeana collections
- Generate METS/MODS XML files, a standard format for digital library metadata
- Convert Zenodo metadata to these standardized XML formats, enhancing interoperability
